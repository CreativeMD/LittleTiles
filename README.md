# LittleTiles

This mod allows you to build anything you want. It adds a way to add more detail to everything. 

You can hammer blocks into tiles which can be 4096 (or even more) times smaller than an ordinary minecraft block. 

You can combine your tiles together to create doors, chairs, ladders, no-clip, storage and any kind of furniture structure. 
There are endless possibilities as shown in the [trailer](https://youtu.be/2Hrn4pdV_ac). 

So download this mod and start to go crazy (and maybe post some pics of your work).

*Development for this mod started 2015, since then it has grown to a massive collection of features. Many things needed a lot of tweaking and time to fix all the bugs.*
